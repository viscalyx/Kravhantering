## Architecture
# Architecture and audit scope

This standard-profile audit covers the repository at commit
`d39bb52daa5446392cc825dca40325f49b9e3241`, including the existing untracked
`.github/skills/security-audit/` tooling. No prior compatible audit ledger was
found under repository temporary output or the default audit location.

Kravhantering is a requirements-management application. Ordinary users read
published requirements; area owners/coauthors author requirements. Specification
responsible people/coauthors manage their assigned specifications. Reviewers
make explicit review decisions. Admin and PrivacyOfficer are separate global
roles. The main isolation boundary is assignment-scoped objects in a shared SQL
Server database, not a tenant-ID partition. Protected resources include drafts,
specifications, assignments, personal identity, privacy exports, audit records,
AI provider credentials, and release/deployment authority.

The application uses Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, SQL Server/TypeORM,
openid-client, jose, iron-session, MCP SDK, Sharp and React PDF. Browser identity
uses OIDC code flow with state, nonce and PKCE; sealed cookies carry identity and
expiry. The proxy strips identity headers. REST transport policy is centralized;
mutation wrappers enforce authentication, same-origin checks and declared
policies. Shared services and assignment authorization mediate resource access.
MCP uses separately validated bearer identity and a stateless transport, then
calls shared services. Important starting points are `proxy.ts`, `lib/auth/`,
`lib/http/`, `lib/requirements/assignment-authorization.ts`, and `lib/mcp/`.

Business inputs include route/query identifiers, JSON mutations, imported
requirements, stored text/URLs, state transitions and optimistic revision tokens.
Review requirements, specifications/agreements/deviations/RFI, import validation
sessions, and alternate REST/MCP paths separately. Database writes and locks live
in `lib/dal/`; schema/migrations and required/demo seeds live under `typeorm/`.
Statistics terminology exists, but reconnaissance found no separate implemented
statistics API to invent as an active subsystem.

AI generation and repair accept text and bounded images, construct provider
requests, inspect generated content, and produce candidates for human import.
Models have no intended autonomous publication authority. Connection trust checks
origins, DNS, pinned transport and redirects. Server-held encrypted provider
secrets and operator root keyrings are distinct trust boundaries. Review
`lib/ai/`, `app/api/ai/`, and AI admin routes, including forensic copies, cost
coordination, cancellation, and external management operations.

Exports, PDF/CSV generation, privacy operations, access reviews, archiving,
audit events and cleanup create derived copies and lifetime boundaries. Review
`lib/privacy/`, `lib/archiving/`, `lib/access-review/`, `lib/reports/`,
`lib/generated-output/`, `lib/pdf/`, and `lib/transient-cleanup/`. Browser rendering,
URL policy, client state and MCP HTML are parallel output sinks.

HSA person lookup is a separate identity subsystem: application requests,
REST-to-SOAP adapter, directory mock, strict certificate validation, and test PKI
provisioner. Inspect `lib/hsa/` and the three `containers/hsa-*` service packages.
Business listeners use mTLS; health listeners are separate. Certificate renewal,
subject binding, XML parsing and returned-person binding require their own units.

Production deployment supports standalone Next runtime, separate database/cleanup
jobs, nginx, and Quadlet templates for single-node, app-node HTTP and app-node TLS.
Hardened/local Keycloak and external OIDC variants select different ingress paths.
Release scripts validate provenance and publish artifacts; GitHub workflows own
privileged release credentials. Azure development scripts provision hosts and
remote bootstrap state. Starting paths include `.github/workflows/`,
`scripts/release/`, `scripts/containers/`, `containers/production/`, and
`scripts/azure-dev/`. Glossary-only Deployment Composer concepts are not presumed
to have an implementation.

Selected companion domains are HTTP/auth, browser, AI/MCP, data lifecycle,
resource availability, RPC/SOAP, supply chain, cloud/deployment and privileged
local files. Each ledger unit records exact selected and excluded blocks.
No application-owned native binary parser, mobile app, broker or webhook entry
was found; dependency internals and externally deployed policy are not assumed
safe or vulnerable. No meaningful comparable requirements product was established.

Execution is source-only: the trusted bubblewrap capability probe failed with
`No permissions to create new namespace`. Required network/mount isolation is
unavailable, so no target tests/builds/processes or live/shared services may run.
Runtime-dependent leads need bounded validation in a suitable future sandbox.
Offline fixtures exist, but builds write generated source/`.next`; SQL and
Playwright workflows may touch development services and are prohibited here.
No dependency installation or vulnerability-database refresh is performed.

Source establishes intended controls, not actual IdP claim issuance, proxy
attachment, cloud/DB grants, network exposure, secret provisioning, provider data
handling, branch protections or deployed revisions. Report precise missing facts.

## Final record verification
### Phase 5: Verify the final records with fresh eyes

Launch one fresh `research` verifier per final `confirmed` and `needs_validation` record, in parallel. This verifier checks the structured record, not the hunter write-up, and remains inside source/local boundaries.

In a `quick` run, Phase 3 and Phase 5 merge: the Phase 3 verifier also performs these record checks and returns the final schema-shaped record, so each candidate gets one fresh independent reviewer instead of two. Every other profile keeps the two passes separate. Never skip independent review of a `confirmed` record in any profile.

For `confirmed`, require it to check:

1. Every repository-relative trace/evidence path, line, scope, and described operation.
2. Real entry interface and exact local input shape.
3. Every condition, parser/policy step, source-visible preventing layer, and observed local result.
4. Affected principal/resource and demonstrated impact.
5. Severity separation: realistic likelihood, demonstrated impact, overall no greater than impact.
6. Remediation strategy and any `code_changes`, including whether the fix enforces the invariant without merely moving trust.

For `needs_validation`, require it to check:

1. The source path is real and supports only the `claimed_root_cause` stated.
2. Every listed blocker is decisive and not already answerable locally.
3. The candidate names a boundary and a possible concrete result rather than a generic concern.
4. At least one validation-plan field is present and exact. `local` uses a bounded fixture; `deployment` asks an owner to observe a configuration, identity, route, policy, or runtime fact. Do not invent a plan for an inapplicable context, and never send audit traffic to a deployment.
5. The fingerprint matches prior/current records for the same root cause.

Each verifier returns exactly one JSON object: `{"decision":"verified","fingerprint":"..."}` or `{"decision":"replace","reason":"...","record":{...}}`, with no surrounding prose. A replacement record must match its `confirmed`, `needs_validation`, or `rejected` schema branch. Treat a malformed or prose-wrapped Phase 5 result the same way as in Phase 3: discard it without repairing it and re-run with a fresh verifier when the budget permits.

Do not apply a Phase 5 replacement as final when it promotes a record to a stronger verdict, including any promotion to `confirmed`, or materially changes the root cause, trace, execution input or observed result, demonstrated impact, or severity. Give that complete replacement to a new independent verifier that did not hunt, perform Phase 3 validation, or propose the Phase 5 replacement. The new verifier rechecks the current source and independently reproduces any decisive local result under the execution boundary, then returns `verified` or another replacement. Apply a material replacement only after this fresh verification. If another material replacement results, repeat with a fresh verifier. If budget or independence is unavailable, remove the disputed record from `findings.json`, keep its ledger unit as an unresolved candidate, and set `run_status: "incomplete"` with an exact `incomplete_reason`. Non-material wording or repository-line corrections may be applied directly when they do not change meaning or evidence.

After every applied replacement, rerun both validators and update linked ledger decisions. If a final verifier identifies a separate root cause, assign a new fingerprint and send it through independent candidate validation before inclusion. Set `run_status: "complete"` only when every ledger candidate has an independent final disposition and every retained record passes Phase 5.

Do not verify only `confirmed` records. A misleading `needs_validation` handoff wastes owner time and can preserve a false premise.


## Relevant companion validation blocks
## Validation rules (apply before reporting ANY finding here)

1. Establish the active source path and effective deployment object; otherwise use `needs_validation` and state which rendered manifest or owner-observed attachment is missing.
2. Name the lower-trust caller/workload, cloud or application identity, controllable selector, affected resource, and unauthorized operation or disclosure.
3. Verify provider and orchestrator defaults at the pinned version. Do not assume a public IP, reachable metadata service, permissive firewall, or absent admission attachment.
4. Local validation may render templates, evaluate policy, inspect container/user namespaces in an isolated fixture, or run an emulator with dummy identities. Do not probe live endpoints or alter shared cloud resources.
5. Return `confirmed` only with a complete active source trace and concrete boundary result. Return `needs_validation` with the exact deployed policy, identity attachment, overlay, network, or drift observation needed.
## Promotion procedure
Artifact promotion procedure (trusted parent-side code only):
Reference only for you: the parent performs these steps; you never perform them.

Before execution, the parent opens and retains trusted, non-inheritable directory
descriptors for the agent's scratch/ and artifacts/ roots, and records an allowlist
of expected scratch-relative artifact files plus explicit per-file and cumulative
byte limits. Never pass those descriptors to the agent or sandbox. After the sandbox
and all its processes terminate, trusted parent-side code promotes each allowlisted
file separately:

1. Validate the declared relative path: reject absolute, empty, `.`, `..`, or
   symlinked components.
2. Walk each parent component from the retained scratch-root descriptor with
   no-follow directory-relative operations; never reopen by path.
3. Open the leaf no-follow and nonblocking.
4. Verify with `fstat` that it is a regular file with link count exactly one and
   within the recorded per-file and cumulative byte limits.
5. Enforce those limits again while reading from that descriptor.
6. Copy exactly the verified size, repeat `fstat`, and reject a changed identity,
   type, link count, or size.
7. For the destination, walk every parent component from the retained
   artifacts-root descriptor with no-follow directory-relative operations; require
   each existing component to be a real directory, and create any missing directory
   exclusively before reopening and verifying it no-follow.
8. Create the leaf exclusively without following links, verify that the opened
   destination is a regular file with link count exactly one, and copy from the
   verified source descriptor without reopening either path.
9. Use equivalent race-safe APIs on non-POSIX systems.
10. Never recursively copy or glob scratch, extract an archive into artifacts, or
    open or promote a symlink, FIFO, socket, device, directory, hard-linked file,
    changing file, or file that exceeds its bound.
11. If any check is unavailable, cannot be enforced, or fails, discard the scratch
    entry; if it is decisive evidence, retain `needs_validation` with the exact
    promotion blocker.
